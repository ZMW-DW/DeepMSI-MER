# DeepMSI-MER

## Project Overview

The project implements **DeepMSI-MER**, a multi-modal information fusion-based emotion recognition model. The experiments use the **IEMOCAP** and **MELD** datasets, and a **10-fold cross-validation** is employed for model evaluation. After each fold, the best F1 model and its output results are saved.

## Environment Requirements

To successfully run this experiment, you will need the following hardware and software configurations:

### Hardware Requirements
- At least two H20/96GB machines and 300GB of memory are required to run the experiment.

### Software Requirements
- **Linux** operating system.
- **conda** environment management tool.
- Python 3.x.

## Environment Setup

### Install Dependencies

1. Clone the project and navigate to the project directory:
```sh
      git clone https://github.com/ZMW-DW/DeepMSI-MER.git
      cd DeepMSI-MER
```
2. Create and activate a conda environment:
```sh   
      conda create --name your_env_name python=3.x
      conda activate your_env_name
```
3. Install the project dependencies:
```sh
      pip install torch numpy opencv-python pandas sklearn tqdm
```
### Running IEMOCAP Dataset Experiment

1. Navigate to the IEMOCAP folder:
```sh   
      cd IEMOCAP
```   
2. Run the IEMOCAP dataset experiment:
```sh   
      python run_IEMOCAP.py
```
### Running MELD Dataset Experiment

1. Navigate to the MELD folder:
```sh   
      cd MELD
```   
2. Run the MELD dataset experiment:
```sh   
      python run_MELD.py
```
## Dataset Download Instructions

The preprocessed datasets will be uploaded to a public repository. Please ensure that all datasets are placed under the `data/` directory and organized according to their respective dataset names. You may refer to the configuration file in the `IEMOCAP/` folder for the specific storage structure and naming conventions, or adjust them based on your own preferences.

You can download the **IEMOCAP** and **MELD** datasets from the following Hugging Face link:
